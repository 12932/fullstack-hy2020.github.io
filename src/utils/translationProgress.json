/* 
This file tracks the progress of translations, ranging from 0 (part0) 
to 13 (part13). It is used in the page redirection logic to avoid 
various navigation errors when the user tries to access untranslated 
parts of the course. At the same time, it is used to automatically 
redirect the user to the English material (until the part is translated).

So, if you have been working on a translation, remember to update this 
file after completing the translation of a whole part.
